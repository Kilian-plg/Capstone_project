My project is to create a website that functions as a social network. The idea is to allow any user to create a personal account, log in, and publish content that can be seen by other users. Each person would have their own profile and be able to interact with other users’ posts through likes and comments. The website would therefore operate as a simple social platform inspired by existing ones such as Facebook, Instagram, and X, but with clearly defined basic features.

For this application to work, it needs to manage several types of information. First, it must store user data such as usernames, email addresses, passwords, and profile details like a biography or profile picture. Then, the application must store the posts created by users.Fot the elements asociated to the connection I will try to use PocketBase which can at the same time host my website and also manage the conection system. And then, each post is connected to a specific user, contains text content, and includes the date and time it was created.These actions would create connections between different types of data: users, posts, comments, and likes. In addition to posts, the application must also handle interactions such as comments and likes, which connect users to each other and to the content they share. Without this data, there would be no interaction, no dynamic content, and no meaningful behavior in the web application.
